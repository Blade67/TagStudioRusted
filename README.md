## Building

Thanks Tauri's documentation, the OS specific installations are documented there.

### Step 1.

- Installing Tauri and Rust according to **[Tauri's documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)**
- We also intend to use a JavaScript frontend framework, so **we need Node.js installed** as well (also in the docs above).

### Step 2.

- Cloning the project

```
git clone https://github.com/AdamTmHun/TagStudio.git
cd TagStudio
```

### Step 3.

- Installing packages
- We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as package manager. It's fast, space efficient. It's just better.

```
pnpm install
```

### Step 4.

- You can now run a dev server, or build the project.
  > [!WARNING]
  > You may need the `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` AND/OR `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`enviroment variable while running the command below if you get a blank screen.

```
pnpm tauri dev
```

- Building and then running the project.
  > [!CAUTION]
  > Linux: It requires `NO_STRIP=true` as enviroment variable due to a bug in linuxdeploy, which is used to build .Appimage file.

```
pnpm tauri build
```

### Step 5.

> [!WARNING]
> You may need the `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` AND/OR `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` enviroment variable while running the command below if you get a blank screen.

- Locate the binary in `/src-tauri/target/release/bundle`, pray and then run it.
